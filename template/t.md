# Bocchi the Rock

You want a show about four or five cute moe girls with multicolored hair, multicolored eyes, and multicolored personalities? Because the anime community has a fucking ocean of options for you to choose from in that department. Some might argue a landfill to be a much more fitting analogy though, because, after all, quantity doesn’t always equal quality. There’s a lot of unexceptional sewage that flows through every season and every genre of anime, and Bocchi the Rock! is miles above any of that, but I’m quite positive we are not witnessing a modern classic in the making. The visual direction is impressive outright—no surprise considering the director’s association with Shingo Natsume, one of the industry’s currently active creative geniuses—but while it may be just enough to carry the series’ more unexceptional elements, it’s nowhere near enough to elevate it... which is kind of a picky distinction to make, but a distinction I would argue is more than a little necessary considering the wildly high mean score Bocchi the Rock! boasts as of time of writing. I apologize for failing to escape comparison, but keep in mind that from where I’m standing, you people started it, not me. You people were the ones talking about “the K-On! of our generation,” not me, and when I read proclamations such as these, I have certain expectations in mind, because the last time I heard such proclamations was in winter of 2018. A Place Further Than The Universe was a special anime. It had powerful performances, fantastic direction, a satisfying sense of progression and growth, and a heartrending emotional arc; it had a more-or-less high-quality production, a plethora of fantastic insert songs, and simply beautiful imagery. It at the same time, however, failed to hit that level of sheer believability and down-to-Earth realism that a K-On!-class masterpiece would, and if you ask me, Bocchi the Rock! falls even shorter.

"Wow, my latest video already has so many comments. [giggles] I’ve been racking up the views lately, too, and people are telling me I’m good… Yeah, maybe it’s okay if I can’t handle real life? There are tons of people cheering for me online!"

There’s a lot of blatantly obvious reasons why I, of all fucking people, would be compelled to call this series and specifically this character “relatable,” but relating to her isn’t my problem. My problem is believing in her. In winter of 2018, some anons on /a/ were criticizing a scene in A Place Further Than The Universe which they felt to have been a shameless rip-off of a scene from K-On!, and whether or not I agreed with their cynical assessment or not, I couldn’t help but entertain the comparison. The scene was in one of the earlier episodes, when the girls were training and first spending a night together outdoors, sleeping in a tent. As they laid back and tried to sleep, they kept each other awake with silly small-talk and dumb jokes, and this thread on /a/ had completely convinced themselves that the scene was attempting to directly mimic the scene from the Kyoto trip in K-On!, the scene after the pillow fight where Ritsu keeps trying to prod at Mio, scare her, and make Yui and Mugi laugh. If you read a text summary of both those scenes, they would seem to be fundamentally identical, but when you actually sit down and watch them, one feels ever so slightly fake (or perhaps “forced” is a better word), while the other feels deeply real. Bocchi the Rock! has cute character designs and good voice acting; it has a surprisingly consistent and well-balanced production considering the studio behind it; it has a clear sense of inspiration and emotion spearheaded by an up-and-coming director who clearly learned all the right lessons from mentors past; and it has dialogue, monologue, and audiovisual expression that will 100% make you feel at times emotional, be it for a second, a minute, or a while. It does not, however, have a scene of Tainaka Ritsu saying goofy shit to keep her best friends from falling asleep on their trip to Kyoto, because she loves them and doesn’t want the moment to end.

# Girls' Last Tour

Thorough the journey of Chito and Yuuri, the author- *tkmiz*- leaves many rooms for his readers to be alone with their thoughts. In particular, he would use open-ended question dialogues, provocative panels, and instances where the two heroines say innocent phrases that hold reflected meanings. If you are unfamiliar with *Girls' Last Tour (GLT)*, these elements would mostly appear random, and completely incoherent with the entire series. In worst cases, you may consider these—and consequently the series—superficial, propagandistic, or simply boring.

That misconception is reasonable, because all this cuteness, all this easy-going atmosphere, all this delightful journey are just a viscerally depressing obfuscation of the series' true themes. There is no such a thing or a message that is "superficial" or "propagandistic" in *GLT*. It just felt surreal at first because the readers are designed to be in that false perspective. In fact, that's why the anime is ranked #348 on [MAL](https://myanimelist.net), while the manga is ranked #49 (as of 28-Nov-2023, and it's been there for *years*). As the story progresses beyond the anime adaptation, readers come to revelations which don't change the story's context, but instead change the perspective of the readers dramatically.

Here, I must emphasize three things that *tkmiz* excels at when crafting a plot twist:

1. The plot twist doesn't emerge unexpectedly; it operates at the level of sophistication seen in *"Better Call Saul"*: It doesn't serve as a cheap shortcut to progress the story. Instead, it unfolds organically, seamlessly integrated as a culmination of the series' intricate narrative progression.
2. Once the twist hits, the whole *GLT* effectively transforms into a different series, such one that reveals profound insights into despair, nihilism, stoicism, and the unprecedentedly genuine appreciation of the little things in life.
3. In contrast to those fictional works like *"Doki Doki Literature Club,"* where the plot twist doesn't fundamentally alter the context of the characters' past actions or dialogues, learning the plot twist of *GLT* changes everything about the series. It's like *"The Witch's House"*–where you don't know the fiendish pain you've been bestowing unto others until you do. In *GLT*, you don't know what you've been witnessing until you do.

The readers' perspective changes dramatically, but seamlessly- for that *tkmiz* constructed a narrative that resonates deeply within the unconscious mind. Without emphasizing on anything other than the seemingly random details and elements, *GLT* cultivates genuine care from readers for every character and even inanimate object. Remember that panel where Chito stands powerlessly before Kettenkrad? Remember what Chito did to her diary & what Yuuri did to her rifle? *Tsukumizu* used **ZERO** word to describe the bond between his characters and these objects; but yet, these panels hit like a leviathanly ultra gigantic truck.

In summary, *Girls' Last Tour*- much like all masterful literary works there are- hides its messages all within the subtext. But don't bother to unearth them all, just simply enjoy whatever lies before your eyes instead; truthfully, I don't believe I fully comprehend the series myself. Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced that *GLT* rewards concentrated readers with both soothing sentiments, strong emotions, and deep-root melancholy, all at once.

Thank you for reading.

# Orientation Certainty Level

If $\vec{v}$ is a unit vector:

$$ dist(O, P_{i} ' ) = \vec{P_{i}} \cdot \vec{v} = \sum_{d=1}^D P_{id} v_{d} $$ {#eq:1}

Therefore, the variance of projections is:

$$ V = \dfrac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d} - \mu)^2 $$
{#eq:2}

By performing a geometric transformation such that
$\mu_{x} = \mu_{y} = 0$,
variable $\mu$ of [@eq:2] then has the value of $0$.
Thus, the formula to calculate the variance of projections is simplified to:

$$ V = \dfrac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d})^2 $$
{#eq:3}

The goal is to find a vector $\vec{v}$ with the length of 1 unit
such that $V$ is maximized.
And thus, I add a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to [@eq:3]:

$$
V = \dfrac{1}{N} \times
\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d})^2 -
\lambda (\sum_{d=1}^D v_{d}^2 - 1)
$$
{#eq:4}

To find local min/max of $V$, I derive [@eq:4] into:

$$
\dfrac{\delta V}{\delta v_{a}} 
= \dfrac{2}{N} \times
\sum_{i=1}^N \left( p_{ia} \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d}) \right) -
2 \lambda v_{a}
$$
{#eq:5}

At $\dfrac{\delta V}{\delta v_{a}} = 0$:

$$
\dfrac{2}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( p_{ia} \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d}) \right) = 2 \lambda v_{a}
$$
$$
\Leftrightarrow
\sum_{d=1}^D v_{d} \left( \dfrac{2}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N p_{ia} p_{id} \right) = 2 \lambda v_{a}
$$
$$
\Leftrightarrow
\sum_{d=1}^D v_{d} \left( 2 cov(p_{a}, p_{d}) \right) = 2 \lambda v_{a}
$$
{#eq:6}

Since the image is two-dimensional, $\vec{v}$ has 2 components $v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$;
[@eq:6] is simplified into:

$$
\Leftrightarrow \begin{cases}
  v_{x}cov(p_{x}, p_{x}) + v_{y}cov(p_{x}, p_{y}) = \lambda v_{x} \\
  v_{x}cov(p_{y}, p_{x}) + v_{y}cov(p_{y}, p_{y}) = \lambda v_{y}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\Leftrightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
var(p_{x}) & cov(p_{x}, p_{y}) \\
cov(p_{y}, p_{x}) & var(p_{y})
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_{x} \\
v_{y}
\end{bmatrix}
= \lambda
\begin{bmatrix}
v_{x} \\
v_{y}
\end{bmatrix}
\Leftrightarrow
A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
$$
{#eq:7}

The fact that $A$ is a matrix and $\lambda$ is a scalar implies that
$\vec{v}$ must be an eigenvector. Consequently, the eigenvectors are
the directions along which the dataset has minimum/maximum variance.
In other words, find $\vec{v}$ such that:

$$ \left( \dfrac{\delta V}{\delta v_{a}} = 0 \right) $$

Next, I need to find the variance magnitude in the direction
of those eigenvectors, which is equivalent to the minimum/maximum variance
of the dataset along a direction.

Breaking down the aforementioned variance of projections equation ([@eq:3]), I have:

$$
V = \dfrac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D (p_{id} v_{d})^2 
$$
$$
= \dfrac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i=1}^N
\left( \sum_{a=1}^D p_{ia} v_{a} \right)
\left( \sum_{d=1}^D p_{id} v_{d} \right)
$$
$$
= \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{d=1}^D 
\left( \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N p_{ia} p_{id} \right) v_{d} v_{a}
$$
$$
= \sum_{a=1}^D
\left( \sum_{d=1}^D cov(p_{a}, p_{d}) v_{d} \right)
v_{a}
$$
{#eq:7}

With $\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector,
and $\sum_{d=1}^D v_{d} \left( 2 cov(p_{a}, p_{d}) \right) = 2 \lambda v_{a}$ having been proven above,
[@eq:7] is then simplified into:

$$ V = \sum_{a=1}^D \left( \lambda v_{a} \right) v_{a} $$
$$ = \lambda ||v||^2 = \lambda $$
{#eq:8}

Thus, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ equal to the variance
along the direction pointed by their corresponding eigenvectors.

Consequently, the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$ is the maximum spread
of the dataset along a direction. \break
While the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{2}$ indicate the minimum one.

By using these proofs and calculating $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$,
I can define whether a block has a clear trend in orientation.
The clearer the trend is, the larger $\lambda_{1}$ is compared to $\lambda_{2}$.
Otherwise, $\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{2}$ approaches $0$.

The covariance matrix of 2 gradient images $gx$ and $gy$ is calculated as:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
var(dx) & cov(dx, dy) \\
cov(dy, dx) & var(dy) 
\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix}
a & c \\
c & b
\end{bmatrix}
$$
{#eq:8}

We then find the eigenvalues $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ of $A$, which indicate
the maximum and minimum variance of the dataset while being projected onto 1 line:

$$ A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow A \vec{v} = \left( \lambda \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \vec{v} $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow A \vec{v} - \left( \lambda \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow \left(A - \lambda \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} a - \lambda & c \\ c & b - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \vec{v} = \vec{0} $$
{#eq:9}

Because $\vec{v}$ is non-zero vector:

$$ det \left( \begin{bmatrix} a - \lambda & c \\ c & b - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = 0 $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow (a - \lambda)(b - \lambda) - c^2 = 0 $$
$$ \Leftrightarrow \begin{cases}
  \lambda_{1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( (a + b) + \sqrt{(a-b)^2 + 4c^2} \right) \\
  \lambda_{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( (a + b) - \sqrt{(a-b)^2 + 4c^2} \right)
\end{cases} $$
{#eq:10}

Thus, $\lambda_{1}$ is the maximum variance of the dataset along one direction,
while $\lambda_{2}$ is the minimum.

The orientation certainty level $(ocl)$ of a block
can be then calculated as follow:

$$ ocl = \dfrac{ \lambda_{2} }{ \lambda_{1} }  \quad \quad \quad ( 0 \leq ocl \leq 1 ) $$
{#eq:11}

With low (high) ocl values, the local structure and orientation
of ridges and valleys are very regular (irregular), and therefore
the block has good (bad) quality.
